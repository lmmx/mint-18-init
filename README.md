# mint-18-init

Initialising a new OS is a pain in the neck, this is a minimal guide to how I set up Mint for working as I was used to, with my laptop on Mint 17 still in use alongside to compare against and provide files if needed.

- Manual steps may be best to do first
  - The order is the one I ended up using, not necessary
- Programmatic steps should be done in order, as they rely on prior installations etc.
  - (Feel free to use your own judgement)
  - See `programmatic/0_config/` folder for options to configure in setup script

Please send pull requests rather than raising issues - I'm not qualified to support Linux installation issues and the community (AskUbuntu, StackOverflow _etc._ is much more suitable). That said, if there are mistakes or improvements, please do feel free to send these as PRs and improve this as a resource for others.
