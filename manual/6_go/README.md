- install Go binary from the official site, dot files should handle the GOPATH and PATH
- should work out of the box

```sh
git clone git@github.com:lmmx/dot-scripts.git ~/.scripts
```

A variety of custom scripts should then be available (including Go precompiled binaries,
but Go itself will also be able to regenerate them).
