- Visit [Google](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) Chrome download page, get installer

- Send usage statistics to Google preferably (yes tracking, but also stability for Linux is a problem that won't get better on its own)
- Chrome has best ecosystem, personal choice of ease of use over Firefox

- Sign in to Chrome (top right) then minimise the window while your multiple browser add-ons load (and the developers' _thank you for installing_ message appears.
  - Then log in to all services [many via Google, and with use of a password manager takes no time]

- Also note: if you use _OneTab_, retrieve old backups of _OneTab_ tabs directly from the file system [e.g. if restoring rather than deliberately moving across systems] with the (SQLite database) file `chrome-extension_chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall_0.localstorage` stored under:
  - Linux: `~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Local Storage/`
  - OS X: `/Users/your-user-name/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage/`
  - Windoze: `C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Storage`
